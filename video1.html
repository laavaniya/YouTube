Ja'mie King: Ja'mie arrives at Summer Heights High for an orientation day ahead of her first day of the student exchange program. After a tour by principal Ms Margaret Murray, Ja'mie introduces herself at school assembly, bragging about her rich and lavish lifestyle from "one of the most expensive private girls' schools in the state". She tells the students that she feels sorry for them, thinking that they are all povo bogans and "really dumb".

Mr G: Mr G is supporting Head of Drama Mrs Meredith Cotton with the upcoming school production of Anything Goes. He then brags about his life story in performing arts and discusses a typical drama class, where he incorporates his unique teaching style. He sees his role at the school to teach drama and dance to change lives, inspire students, and to encourage the students to dare to dream. Along with his loyal sidekick, science teacher, Mr Rodney Parsons, Mr G criticises and is frustrated by his superior Mrs Meredith Cotton, as well as complaining about the lack of funding and support given by the school's principal.

Jonah Takalua: Jonah first appears in the office of the student welfare officer, Mr Doug Peterson, after a bullying incident at the train station. Mr Peterson later on describes Jonah's family, his school history, his erratic and aggressive behaviour, and his ADHD. In his English class, Jonah is disruptive and rude to others in the class, including to the English teacher, Ms Sarah Wheatley, however he thinks that he gets into trouble because the teachers are racist. Jonah tells of his life ambition to be a professional breakdancer when he is older, and that he is only stupid because he chooses not to be smart.</p>
