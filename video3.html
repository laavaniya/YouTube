	<p> Ja'mie King: Ja'mie decides that it would be a good idea if she dates a younger guy. She therefore targets a Year 7 student, Sebastian â€“ to the shock of her Year 11 friends. However Ja'mie is shocked to discover messages from Sebastian to another girl Year 7 student on his mobile phone but exaggerates the meaning of the texts because they only talk about "saving each other a seat in English". The relationship ends with an emotional confrontation at the school gate.

Mr G: After learning of the death of a Year 11 student, Annabelle Dickson, due to an overdose of ecstasy, Mr G uses the event as his inspiration for the school's new production.

Jonah Takalua: On the day of the junior school dance, Jonah wears pants stained with semen to the school. He is counselled by the school nurse, and ordered to change clothes before the event into clothes which are rather embarrassing for him. During the dance, he becomes involved in a fight with Kieran, a talented Year 7 breakdancer, and is subsequently removed from the event and sent home.
