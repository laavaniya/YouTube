	<p>Ja'mie King: At Ja'mie's first day at Summer Heights High, she is paired with fellow student, Ashley, whom Ja'mie describes as "the fugliest girl I have ever met in my life". Ja'mie is taken to classes and shown around the school by Ashley, and tries to fit in with Ashley and her friends during lunch. After uncomfortable silences caused by the lack of similarities while trying to get to know each other, Ja'mie asks Ashley who the "hot" and "popular" girls of Year 11 are, and promptly asks to be introduced to them. This introduction sees Ja'mie fitting in well with this group of girls and abandons Ashley, however later Ja'mie has an emotional breakdown while remembering the school and friends she left behind while having to deal with the dramatic changes thanks to the exchange program.

Mr G: The Head of Drama, Mrs Meredith Cotton, has had to go to New Zealand due to her mother suddenly falling very ill, and therefore Mr G has been promoted to Acting Head of Drama, renaming his title as "Director of Performing Arts". Thrilled with the temporary promotion, he makes a few changes such as clearing-out Ms Cotton's desk and moving himself in, and walking around the school to pass on the news to students of his new role. He also gets support staff to do work for him, complains about noise from the gym, and requests teachers "under the umbrella of Performing Arts" to fill-in classes and duties he is too busy for; fellow teaching staff complain to the Principal about his now selfish and bossy demeanour. He also unveils plans for a new performing arts centre with a 10,000-seat theatre complex that will require the demolition of demountable classrooms used by the special education students. Mr G then cancels the school production Anything Goes with plans to write his own "better show".

Jonah Takalua: Jonah and his friends participate in an ethnic acceptance program created by the school's student welfare officer, Mr Doug Peterson, called "Polynesian Pathways", and enrolls Jonah into 'a contract' to get Jonah to improve his behaviour and academic levels. With his best friend, Leon, Jonah is also enrolled at Gumnut Cottage for remedial reading lessons five periods a week with Ms Jan Palmer, who seems to understand Jonah better than her fellow teachers and begins to form a connection with him. Jonah is reading at an eight-year-old level, however gets angry at having to read children's books and continues his disruptive behaviour as seen in other classes.</p>
